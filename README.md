# miniwdl + GWFCore + SageMaker Studio

This repository is a recipe for deploying **[miniwdl-aws](https://github.com/miniwdl-ext/miniwdl-aws)** and [GWFCore](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-genomics-workflows) to use within [Amazon SageMaker Studio](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/studio/), a web IDE with a terminal and filesystem browser. You can use the terminal to operate `miniwdl run` against GWFCore's AWS Batch stack, the filesystem browser to manage the inputs and outputs on EFS, and the Jupyter notebooks to further analyze the outputs.
